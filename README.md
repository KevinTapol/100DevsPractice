The goal here is to demonstrate Object Oriented Programming Pillars of Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEhs4XtuAgA&ab_channel=LeonNoel" >Click here for 100Devs Youtube video on OOP review of Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism review using Classes, Constructors, extended Classes and objects created from them.</a>


**Encapsulation** - The process of storing functions (methods) with their associated data (properties) in one thing (object).


 - But why? - Made it easier to add new stuff, to read through what was already coded, and made it so you were not afraid to make changes.


**Abstraction** - Hide details and show essentials.


 - But why? - Smaller more manageable pieces of code


**Inheritance** - Make a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods.


 - But why? - Helps you eliminate redundant code.


**Polymorphism** - Code written to use an interface automatically knows how to work with any number of different objects that provide the interface.


 - But why? - Helps you avoid if/else and switch cases. Also makes your code reusable.

### *Encapsulation is being used here to combine the properties and methods into one object.*

### *Abstraction is being used here as the getter to return the this._input naming convention. Also super is abstracting the inheritance of the getters for this._name and this._role.*


### *Inheritance is being used with the super(inherited properties) to go up one class and grab the properties and getters associated with it.*


### *Polymorphism is being used with the sayHello() method. As shown in the for loop of the array of objects, each object is using the same method but achieving a different console based on their object class.*
