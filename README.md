The goal here is to demonstrate Object Oriented Programming Pillars of Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

**Encapsulation** - The process of storing functions (methods) with their associated data (properties) in one thing (object).


    But why? - Made it easier to add new stuff, to read through what was already coded, and made it so you were not afraid to make changes.


**Abstraction** - Hide details and show essentials.


    But why? - Smaller more manageable pieces of code


**Inheritance** - Make a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods.


    But why? - Helps you eliminate redundant code.


**Polymorphism** - Code written to use an interface automatically knows how to work with any number of different objects that provide the interface.


    But why? - Helps you avoid if/else and switch cases. Also makes your code reusable.
